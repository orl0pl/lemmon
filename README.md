## Build from source

### Prerequisites

- Install [flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install): To check if this step was successful run `flutter doctor` (Installing android studio is not required if you setup the android SDK yourself)
- Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/orl0pl/lemmon`
- Enter the repo: `cd lemmon`

### Android

1. Build: `flutter build apk --flavor prod --target lib/main_prod.dart --release`

The apk will be in `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-prod-release.apk`


## FAQ

### "App not installed" - what to do?

When installing the APK directly you might get this message. This happens when you are trying to update lemmon from a different source than where you originally got it from. To fix it simply uninstall the previous version (you will lose all local data) and then install the new one. Always make sure to install lemmon APKs only from verified sources.
